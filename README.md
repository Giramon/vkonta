Simple HTML5 guitar tuner

I was using [TuxGuitar](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tuxguitar/) and a very simple music sheet to tune my guitar, but it's overkill, and the actual sound playing on Windows by Java can be troublesome.

So, thanks to https://github.com/keithwhor/audiosynth/audiosynth.js for the difficult part of inline javascript synthetizer, I have crafted this basic tuner web application.
